> GPG Password Manager

**ppass** is heavily inspired from **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**

I wanted to extend some of its functionnalities, and decided to rewrite the application in Python. It was a good exercice to try Python as I am more used to program in js/ts and c++/qt.

This beeing said, **ppass** is not as well tested or stable as **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**. I intend to make it evolve in the future, as I am using it on a daily basis. I am however alone on this one. If you want stability and portability, with a great community, please use **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**.

Stores created with **ppass** are 100% compatible with **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**. They are thus also compatible with pass clients like [Android Password Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store#readme).


**Main features**
* gpg password creation (one file per password)
* enhanced password file with username, url and comments
* git integration
* possibility to handle several distinct stores
* open web browser from password file
* automatic fill in username and password to web browser
* cli user interface or json response

**Roadmap**
* autocompletion
* enhanced clip functionnality
* code cleaning
* more to come...

A deb package is available, built using `dh-virtualenv`. Installing this package will create a new Python virtual environment in `opt/venvs`. It will then create the symlink `usr/bin/ppass` pointing to `opt/venvs/ppass/bin/ppass`.

Download latest `.deb` file from the [release page](https://github.com/sguerri/ppass/releases).

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ppass_0.1.7_amd64.deb
```

### Install from ppa

The deb file is also available in my ppa.
