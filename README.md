> GPG Password Manager

**ppass** is heavily inspired from **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**

I wanted to extend some of its functionnalities, and decided to rewrite the application in Python. It was a good exercice to try Python as I am more used to program in js/ts and c++/qt.

This beeing said, **ppass** is not as well tested or stable as **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**. I intend to make it evolve in the future, as I am using it on a daily basis. I am however alone on this one. If you want stability and portability, with a great community, please use **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**.

Stores created with **ppass** are compatible with **[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)**. They are thus also compatible with pass clients like [Android Password Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store#readme).


**Main features**
* gpg password creation (one file per password)
* enhanced password file with username, url and comments
* git integration
* possibility to handle several distinct stores
* open web browser from password file
* automatic fill in username and password to web browser
* cli user interface or json response

**Roadmap**
* autocompletion
* enhanced clip functionnality
* test on other platforms
* produce deb files (tested with dh-virtualenv but dependent python version)
* code cleaning
* more to come...

## Installation

### Requirements

The application is developped and used on ubuntu 21.10, with python 3.9.7. Any feedback on other platforms is welcomed.

<mark>A VOIR xdotool + wayland</mark>

- python3 >=3.7,<4.0
- xdotool: `sudo apt install xdotool`
- git: `sudo apt install git`
- gpg: `sudo apt install gnupg`
- nano: `sudo apt install nano`
- xclip: `sudo apt install xclip`

### Install from pypi

```bash
pip install ppass
```

For an isolated environment with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
pipx install ppass
```

## Usage

### Initialise

Initialisation is required before using the application, to select GPG identity.

```bash
ppass init
```

A configuration file `.ppassrc` is created in the user home directory.

By default, passwords will be stored in `${HOME}/.ppass/` folder.

The `--edit` option will open configuration file in edit mode.

### Create a folder

A folder needs to be created before creating a password file.

```bash
ppass folders create

# or

ppass folders create --name "Name of folder"
```

### Create a new password

You can then create a new password file.

If you want a new password to be generated:

```bash
ppass generate
```

If you already know the password:

```bash
ppass insert
```

If the is only one folder, it will be selected by default. Otherwise the list of available folders will be prompted for selection.

### Clip username and password

`ppass open` will open a new webbrowser with the saved url

`ppass clip` will copy and paste to the active window the username as well as the password : `{username} {TAB} {password} {RETURN}`

`ppass user` will copy username to clipboard

`ppass pass` will copy password to clipboard

In case a password is saved with your GPG identity, it will be prompted through a modal window.

### Filter

<mark>TODO with enhanced filter</mark>

### Add a new store

You can create several stores (config sections).

```bash
ppass init --new-section
```

<mark>NE MARCHE PAS</mark>

ppass -c "PERSO" init --new-section --path "/home/sebastien/.ppass-perso"

### Initialise from git

### Publish to git




### Change output to JSON
